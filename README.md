# aws-minecraft
AWS configuration for Minecraft server

This repository doesn't represent what I would consider to be best practices for building out a complete infrastructure in AWS using Terraform, but it was a really fun project to explore the features of Terraform at the time.

Since this is a personal project, there is no real documentation nor is anything laid out in any sort of consistent way. It's more of a living workspace of what I was doing at the time.
